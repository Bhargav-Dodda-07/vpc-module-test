# Exclude all .tfvars files, which may contain sensitive data.

# If you wish to track .tfvars files, add a line to negate the

# Example: !terraform.tfvars
*.tfvars

# Ignore override files that terraform generates when using the "-out" option
# and the plan is saved to a file
#
# Note: This is an old feature behavior and not the recommended way to run terraform
# as a plan file is not a complete representation of the state of the infrastructure.
# Use remote state instead.

# plan generated file

# Ignore the lock file which is for local use only.
# Keep the "lock" file in the repository (see below)
